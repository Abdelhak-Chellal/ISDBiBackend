REVERSE_TX_TEMPLATE = f"""
The following financial event occurred: {{template}}. 
Identify the applicable AAOIFI FAS standard(s). If more than one standard may apply, assign a weighted likelihood

REVERSE_TX_TEMPLATE_2 = f"""
Example:
Context: GreenTech exits in Year 3, and Al Baraka Bank buys out its stake.
Adjustments:
- Buyout Price: $1,750,000
- Bank Ownership: 100%
- Accounting Treatment:
  - Derecognition of GreenTechâ€™s equity
  - Recognition of acquisition expense
- Journal Entry for Buyout:
  Dr. Investment in GreenTech       1,750,000
      Cr. Cash                      1,750,000
(To record acquisition of GreenTechâ€™s equity)

Applicable Standards:
1. FAS 4 â€“ 70% â€“ Applies because the transaction affects presentation of equity in financial statements.
2. FAS 20 â€“ 30% â€“ May apply if the investment was accounted for using the equity method.
3. FAS 32 â€“ 0% â€“ Not relevant; applies only to Ijarah (leasing) transactions.

Explanation:
- FAS 4 is the most relevant due to its coverage of equity transactions and financial statement presentation.
- FAS 20 may be considered based on the nature of GreenTech's relationship to the bank (e.g., associate).
- FAS 32 is commonly confused but not applicable here as this is not a lease.

---

Now, perform the same analysis for the following:

The following financial event occurred: {{template}}
Based on AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standards (FAS), identify all potentially applicable standards from FAS 4, FAS 32, FAS 7, FAS 10, and FAS 28.

For each applicable standard, provide a relevance score or percentage (based on how directly it applies).

Rank the standards from most to least relevant.

Justify your selection for each standard in 1â€“2 sentences.

Then, provide the correct accounting treatment by showing the journal entries, with clear account names and explanations.

If any standards are commonly confused or misapplied (e.g., FAS 32 used instead of FAS 4), explain why they are not relevant.
